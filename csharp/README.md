# TIC TAC TOE

 A command-line TIC TAC TOE written in python.

 Two players **X** and **O** will play against each other.

 ## Compilation Instructions

Compile the program using the following command:

```
csc .\*.cs -out:tictactoe.exe -o
```

### Note:
You will need the C# compiler and .NET runtime which can be downloaded through [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

## Clean board

By default the game will look like this:

```
     |     |
  0  |  1  |  2
_____|_____|_____
     |     |
  3  |  4  |  5
_____|_____|_____
     |     |
  6  |  7  |  8
     |     |
```

If you want to disable the numbered board, you have to edit `Program.cs` file and recompile the program.
